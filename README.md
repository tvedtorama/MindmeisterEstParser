Mindmeister Estimate Integration

Estimating requires agility to deal with the dynamic and uncertain nature of the craft.  Mindmeister allows information structures to be editied efficiently, but does not offer estimate aggregation or simple meta data association.

The aim of this project has been to create a separate GUI for Mindmeister, where the following can be editied efficiently within the mind map:

* Estimate, aggregated down
* Priority, aggregated up
* Risk
* Sprint name

For this to work, a special syntax is used, where nodes are appended to the target element.  The syntax is as following:

    {e:nn p:nn r:nn s:aa}

Where nn is any number, aa is alhphanumerical.
